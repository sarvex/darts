        """
        A time series dataset containing tuples of (input, output, input_covariates) arrays, in a way inspired
        by the N-BEATS way of training on the M4 dataset: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437.

        The "input" and "input_covariates" have length `lookback * output_chunk_length`, and the "output" has length
        `output_chunk_length`.

        Given the horizon `output_chunk_length` of a model, this dataset will compute some (input, target) splits as follows
        (the logic for "input_covariates" is the same as for "input"):
        First a "forecast point" is selected in the the range of the last
        `(min_lh * output_chunk_length, max_lh * output_chunk_length)` points before the end of the time series.
        The target then consists in the following `output_chunk_length` points, and the data will be the preceding
        `lookback * output_chunk_length` points.

        All the series in the provided sequence must be long enough; i.e. have length at least
        `(lookback + max_lh) * output_chunk_length`, and `min_lh` must be at least 1
        (to have targets of length exactly `1 * output_chunk_length`).
        The target and covariates time series are sliced together, and therefore must have the same length.
        If these conditions are not satisfied, an error will be raised when trying to access some of the splits.

        The sampling is uniform both over the number of time series and the number of samples per series;
        i.e. the i-th sample of this dataset has 1/(N*M) chance of coming from any of the M samples in any of the N
        time series in the sequence.

        The recommended use of this class is to either build it from a list of `TimeSeries` (if all your series fit
        in memory), or implement your own `Sequence` of time series.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target_series
            One or a sequence of target `TimeSeries`.
        covariates:
            Optionally, one or a sequence of `TimeSeries` containing covariates. If this parameter is set,
            the provided sequence must have the same length as that of `target_series`.
        output_chunk_length
            The length of the "output" series emitted by the model
        lh
            A `(min_lh, max_lh)` interval for the forecast point, starting from the end of the series.
            For example, `(1, 3)` will select forecast points uniformly between `1*H` and `3*H` points
            before the end of the series. It is required that `min_lh >= 1`.
        lookback:
            A integer interval for the length of the input in the emitted input and output splits, expressed as a
            multiple of `output_chunk_length`. For instance, `lookback=3` will emit "inputs" of lengths `3 * output_chunk_length`.
